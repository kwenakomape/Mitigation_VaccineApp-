Mobile application that will allow the medical workers to offer the excess vaccines to eligible people before they go to waste. The application must match the available vaccines in a fair and orderly manner, send offers out to the selected individua

The medical workers at vaccination centres expect a certain number of people to show up each day. If a
clinic has a no-show for a vaccine appointment, the allocated dose cannot be used the following day and
must be discarded, wasting the limited vaccine supply. In this project, I will create a convenient and
usable mobile application that will allow the medical workers to offer the excess vaccines to eligible
people before they go to waste. The application must match the available vaccines in a fair and orderly
manner, send offers out to the selected individuals, guide them to the vaccination centre on time, and
allow for them to be verified once they arrive.
